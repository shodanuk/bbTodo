# bbTodo

Basically, a learning exercise, this is my attempt at the eponymous Todo List app using the following tech stack:

* Backbone
* jQuery
* Local Storage
* Twitter Bootsrap
* Dust templating
* Sinatra (for a basic web server during dev)

## Stuff still to do

* Fix bug that prevents more than one todo item being added at a time without having to reload the page.
* Edit project title.
* Confirmation on project / todo deletion.
* Due dates for todo items.
* Archive projects.
* Lots of styling / visual improvments.
* Get a test version online, probably with Heroku.
* Mobile compatibility.
* Replace jQuery with Zepto.
* Implement AMD / Require.js.
* Replace sinatra with Node.js and build API for server side data persistence with...
* ... MongoDB

## To run locally

Navigate to the route folder and issue the follow command:

`rake server`

Than point your browser at:

http://localhost:9292
